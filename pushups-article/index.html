        <h2 id="opening-salvo">Opening Salvo</h2>
        <p>
          Today, I want to give a shout-out to my favorite exercise of all time:
          the humble push-up.
        </p>
        <p>
          You see, I have this crazy idea that this simple little exercise, if
          practiced diligently and intelligently, can completely transform your
          body and your life. I also believe that if more people did push-ups,
          it would completely change the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you’re confused by these claims, I’m not surprised. Push-ups have a
          reputation for being a mediocre gym-class exercise, the sort of thing
          you do when you’re stuck in a hotel room with no access to workout
          equipment. I thought the same thing myself until I discovered the
          world of <em>progressive calisthenics.</em>
        </p>

        <h2 id="push-ups-progressive">Make Your Push-Ups Progressive</h2>
        <p>
          The basic premise of progressive calisthenics is that by manipulating
          the placement and angles of your limbs, you can make bodyweight
          exercises as difficult or easy as you want. Push-ups, for instance,
          can be made easier by doing them on your knees or against an elevated
          surface. Or they can be made harder by shifting your weight onto a
          single arm or by elevating your feet.
        </p>
        <p>
          This means (a) that push-ups offer an appropriate challenge no matter
          what kind of shape you’re in and (b) that you can gradually make
          yourself stronger by <em>progressing</em> to harder push-up
          variations.
        </p>
        <img
          src="images/pushup-progressions.webp"
          alt="Push-up progressions from Convict Conditioning"
        >
        <p>
          Hopefully the image above gives you a sense of how this works. These
          are pictures from the book <i>Convict Conditioning</i>. Published in
          2009, <i>Convict Conditioning</i> is sort of like the founding text of
          progressive calisthenics. It sparked a small but ever-growing movement
          of athletes who use their own body as a strength-building tool.
        </p>
        <p>
          That said, many have criticized the exercise progressions found in
          <i>Convict Conditioning</i>, and in some cases, I think this criticism
          is valid. The moves with the basketball, for instance, seem
          particularly hard to pull off.
        </p>
        <p>
          Luckily, there are other, more intelligent ways to progress your
          pushups. The site
          <a href="https://startbodyweight.com">startbodyweight.com</a>, for
          instance, offers
          <a href="http://www.startbodyweight.com/p/push-up-progression.html"
            >a great set of push-up progressions</a
          >
          and does the same with other bodyweight exercises, like pullups and
          squats, as well.
        </p>

        <h2 id="push-ups-build-muscle">
          Yes, Progressive Push-Ups Do Build Muscle
        </h2>
        <p>
          Now the inevitable question: can you really get strong by following
          these progressions? I mean, c’mon — I get that one-armed push-ups are
          hard, but how hard are they compared to, say, a heavy bench press?
        </p>
        <p>
          The answer is: yes, you can get strong with push-ups, and yes, they
          are hard — as hard as a heavy bench press.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let’s start with the obvious here. For evidence that progressive
          calisthenics works, all you have to do is look at calisthenics
          practitioners. Take a look at
          <a href="http://www.startbodyweight.com/p/nick-janvier.html"
            >Nick Janvier</a
          >, for instance, creator of that site,
          <a href="https://startbodyweight.com">startbodyweight.com</a>. Do you
          have a physique like that? Didn’t think so.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another, equally impressive example is
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@RedDeltaproject"
            >Matt Schifferle of the Red Delta Project</a
          >.
        </p>
        <img
          src="images/matt-schifferle.webp"
          alt="Matt Schifferle of the Red Delta Project, as shown on the cover of his books"
        >
        <p>
          Matt has arms bigger than my legs and shoulders so broad that he
          probably has to walk through doors sideways. And believe it or not, he
          built his brawn with a basic routine of pushups, dips, pullups, and
          bodyweight squats and lunges.
        </p>
        <p>
          And I — in my own, much more modest way — have also gained muscle and
          strength with the help of pushups.
        </p>
        <p>
          So yes, push-ups work. They’ve worked for me, they’ve worked for other
          people, and they will work for you, as long as you keep making
          progress towards more difficult variants.
        </p>

        <h2 id="push-ups-bench-press">Push-Ups vs. the Bench Press</h2>
        <p>
          But how do push-ups compare to the bench press? Well, let’s talk
          numbers first.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most resources estimate that
          <a
            href="https://www.cooperinstitute.org/blog/how-much-weight-is-really-lifted-during-a-push-up"
            >roughly 70% of the body’s weight is moved through the hands and
            arms during a push-up</a
          >. A 180-pound person such as myself would therefore be pushing around
          125 pounds during a push-up. That may not seem like a lot to a serious
          lifter, but remember: advanced calisthenics athletes do push-ups
          <em>on one hand</em>. For someone who’s 180 pounds, this equates to a
          respectable 250-pound bench press. And of course, there are always
          ways to increase the load even more — by elevating your feet, for
          instance, or by raising one foot off the ground.
        </p>
        <p>
          So in terms of weight moved, push-ups are actually comparable to the
          bench press, as long as they are approached progressively. And they
          also bring a host of other benefits that the bench press simply can’t
          match.
        </p>
        <p>
          For one thing, they’re performed face down with no external support
          from a bench. This means that they require significant activation from
          your core (specifically your abs, obliques, and glutes) to keep your
          hips from sagging towards the floor.
        </p>
        <p>
          And the neat thing is that advanced push-up variations, i.e. those
          which emphasize a single limb, place more demand on the core muscles
          than standard push-ups. So by progressing your push-ups, you’ll be
          progressing your core strength as well as the strength of the pushing
          muscles in your arms, shoulders, and chest.
        </p>
        <p>
          Push-ups are also performed with a cocked wrist and a hand flat
          against the floor. In this position, the joints of the wrist and
          fingers are <i>extended</i>, which requires activation of the
          <i>extensor muscles</i> in your hand and on the top of your forearm.
          This may seem like a minor anatomical detail, but I actually think it
          matters quite a bit. Many of the objects we handle in the real world —
          things like doors, cars, and other people — don’t come with nice
          ergonomic grips. When we push these objects, we have to use our
          extensor muscles to bend our wrist backwards so we can exert force
          through our open hand.
        </p>
        <p>
          So the ability to extend our wrists without injury is actually pretty
          important for real-world pushing strength. The bench press,
          unfortunately, doesn’t train this ability much at all, since the
          object being pushed is a grippable barbell. Gripping things involves
          hand and finger <i>flexion</i>, not extension, and it utilizes the
          hand <i>flexors</i> located on the underside of the forearm, which are
          antagonistic to the hand extensors involved in the push-up.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, there’s no doubt that the hand flexion muscles are an important
          muscle group and that grip is an important physical ability. The
          issue, though, is that these are already a focus of upper-body
          <i>pulling motions</i> — exercises like pull-ups, bent-over rows, etc.
          So as long as you’re practicing a pulling exercise — as you should be
          if you’re seeking well-balanced strength — you don’t need another
          grip-dominant exercise like the bench press in your routine.
        </p>

        <h2 id="advantage-of-push-ups">The #1 Advantage of Push-Ups</h2>
        <p>
          Ok, ok — I’m reading your mind. “These are biomechanical nuances,”
          you’re saying. “I don’t really care if the extensor muscles of my hand
          are being activated. I just want an easy way to build upper-body
          muscle and strength.” Well, fine. Biomechanical nuances aside, here’s
          one more reason to choose push-ups, the most fundamental, incredible,
          <em>groundbreaking</em> reason of all:
        </p>
        <p><em>Push-ups require zero equipment.</em></p>
        <p>
          That’s right: <em>zero</em>. As long as you have about six feet of
          open floor space, you can load the push muscles of your upper body
          with <em>hundreds</em> of pounds of resistance.
        </p>
        <p>
          Meditate on that for a second. You don’t need a gym membership, you
          don’t need an expensive machine, you don’t need a barbell, dumbbell,
          kettlebell, or a pull-up bar. All you need to do push-ups is some open
          floor and two arms. Hell, even one arm will do in a pinch!
        </p>

        <h2 id="push-ups-change-world">Push-Ups Will Change the World</h2>
        <p>
          This remarkable accessibility is ultimately why push-ups are my
          favorite exercise. It’s also why I think push-ups can, and will,
          change the world. That’s a bold statement, I know. But before you
          scoff at it, consider push-ups from a cost-to-benefit perspective.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the costs side, there’s basically nothing. Push-ups are completely
          free. They require no gym, no driving to and from the gym, no gym
          equipment, no embarrassment as you pretend to know how to use said gym
          equipment, no annoyance as you wait to use that gym equipment, no
          special gym clothes, and no special gym shoes. No one even has to know
          that you’re doing push-ups. All you need is five minutes, a little
          floor space, and a bit of effort.
        </p>
        <p>
          And the benefits? Well, if you practice push-ups diligently and
          progressively, they <em>will</em> transform your physicality. And I
          don’t just mean that you’ll gain muscle size and tone. You’ll also
          gain real, palpable, <em>usable</em> upper-body strength, the benefits
          of which are incalculable, especially as you get older.
        </p>
        <p>
          Millions of grandpas would suddenly be able to lift their little
          grandkids into the air. Millions of grandmas would suddenly be able to
          carry their own luggage through the airport. Millions of mothers
          wouldn’t have to call their husbands or sons to help them move the
          coffee table across the living room. Millions of fathers would lose
          their “dad bods” and inspire their children with their strength and
          vigor. And millions of kids would regain that child-like energy and
          vitality that’s currently being dampened by sedentary screen time.
        </p>
        <p>
          And while everyone’s busy getting stronger, they’d also be getting
          healthier. Hearts, lungs, and blood vessels would increase in capacity
          and ability, preventing millions of cases of cardiovascular disease.
          The glucose stores found in the muscles themselves would also
          increase, thereby lowering everyone’s blood sugar and basal insulin
          levels and ultimately preventing millions of cases of diabetes and
          obesity. Even people’s bones would get stronger. Resistance training
          has been shown to increase bone remineralization and bone mineral
          density, a crucial benefit for older people (especially women) at high
          risk of osteoporosis.
        </p>

        <h2 id="resistance-exercise-youth">
          Resistance Exercise is the Fountain of Youth
        </h2>
        <p>
          If all this sounds amazing, that’s because it is. Exercise —
          especially resistance exercise — is an <em>amazing</em> medicine, the
          most holistic, effective medicine we know of actually. In addition to
          the benefits above,
          <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1866181/"
            >resistance exercise has literally been shown to change gene
            expression in older adults</a
          >
          to resemble that of people in their 20s. This means that on a
          transcriptional level (i.e. at the level of your DNA and RNA),
          resistance training literally reverses the process of aging.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here’s what Dr. Doug McGuff, in his excellent book,
          <i>Body by Science</i>, says about this:
        </p>
        <blockquote
          cite="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0071597174?ref_=ppx_hzod_title_dt_b_fed_asin_title_0_0"
        >
          <p>
            “Nothing else in human history has shown a functional reversing of
            age in humans at a molecular level… Now here, after
            <em>millenia</em> of searching for the “fountain of youth” —
            anything that might extend life or objectively reverse aging in
            humans, going back as far as our earliest recorded literature in
            <i>The Epic of Gilgamesh</i> — a clinical study has essential said,
            “Look, here it is — an actual functional reversal of aging at the
            molecular level!” It is astounding that genes that were functioning
            poorly at an elderly level could be returned to a normal level of
            functioning in elderly people” <i>(Body by Science, p. 247)</i>.
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          <em>That’s</em> the type of medicine I’m talking about. And yes, I
          know — these benefits aren’t unique to push-ups. However, push-ups do
          make these benefits <em>uniquely accessible</em> — accessible to
          everyone with arms, in fact. Push-ups are the perfect gateway into the
          world of resistance training, a world you <em>need</em> to familiarize
          yourself with if you want to improve, or even maintain, your health as
          you age.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, whether you’re an out-of-shape couch potato looking to lose some
          fat, a grandmother looking to stay hale and hearty, a health optimizer
          looking to stay forever young, or a 20-year-old kid who just wants to
          look better in a t-shirt — why not give push-ups a try? I’m betting
          that you’ll be pleased with the results.
